For the last few weeks I’ve been playing around with Fable. As a F# enthusiast who had to deal with a lot of JavaScript code during his studies, I was quite curious what Fable was all about. [...]
Being motivated by Super Fable Mario, I thought creating a simple game myself might be a good way to start with Fable. As you can read by the title, I chose Pong as my starting project. So without further ado, let’s start with the actual game.

## [From Elm to Fable](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/from-elm-to-fable/)

A few months ago I started a quest to gain reliability in frontend development. I chose Elm as my starting point. [...]
It turns out that there is an F# to JS compiler called Fable. [...] In this post I'll "convert" the star wars app I wrote in Elm to Fable, and then I'll refactor it.

So finally here it is! It took a bit longer than expected but I'm very happy to announce Fable 0.7 has been released to npm. This version includes lots of improvements thanks to feedback from the community, it's almost a full rewrite and could be considered 1.0 (in fact, 1.0 will probably be this with minor upgrades).
