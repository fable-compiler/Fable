#![no_std]
//! Lightweight (zero dependency, proc_macro free) way to run code before main.
//!
//! This crate is the moral equivalent to the `ctor` crate, although the API is
//! completely different. The main reason for it's existence is:
//!
//! - Much faster to compile â€” no proc macros / syn / quote.
//!
//! - More obviously safe (avoids things I find dodgy, like `dtor`, ctors that
//!   initialize data, uses extern "C" function in function array called from C
//!   ...)
//!
//! - Try to handle untested unix platforms by assuming they support *at least*
//!   the `.ctors` section. This is in line with what clang does to compile c++
//!   static constructors.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! startup::on_startup! {
//!     println!("I'm running before main");
//! }
//! fn main() {
//!     println!("I'm inside main");
//! }
//! ```

/// Run some code automatically before the execution of `main`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// startup::on_startup! {
///     println!("I'm running before main");
/// }
/// fn main() {
///     println!("I'm inside main");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This outputs:
///
/// ```text
/// I'm running before main.
/// I'm inside main.
/// ```
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// - If your program is loaded as a dynamic library via dlopen/LoadLibrary,
///   it's not actually run "before main", but instead "when dlopen is called".
///   In practice, this doesn't matter for most use cases.
///
/// - This is on a best effort basis. There are known `rustc` bugs that will
///   prevent it from working. There are known platforms that don't support it
///   (wasm, maybe others). It is very important that your programs safety not
///   rely on this being called.
///
/// - The order two different `on_startup` invocations run in is totally
///   unspecified. Different platforms do wildly different things here. Do not
///   rely on one particular order. See also C++'s ["static initialization order
///   fiasco" (or problem)][static_init]
///
/// - Not all of the rust stdlib may be supported before main. It's best not to
///   call into it unless you're certain it will work.
