# Fable Library for Lua

This module is used as the [Fable](https://fable.io/) library for
Lua.

On windows, testing was done against lua 5.2.4, which you can get through chocolatey:

https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/lua52
or direct, although it needs to be in the path:
http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html


choco install lua52
